# Conclusions

I spent an afternoon with these docs and attempted the parsing only the find out that the docs are referenced in Github at the following location [Here](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/8.17/docs/reference). 

Given that this is the case, this repository is deprecated. Content downloaded from that documentation will now form the basis of a new repository that will perform chunking and stand up a vector database to make the Elasticsearch documentation searchable by AI agents.
